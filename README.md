# discord-music-bot-
Another music bot supports youtube has embeds queue and a search function I'm still a beginner so the code works but not the best you can find

Recommend using the latest python version

Need : 
discord.py
youtube_dl
youtube-search
ffmpeg

Just replace the token on the bottom in main.py and run it and the bot should work

-add to add songs using url
-search to search
-play to play the songs in the queue
-dc for disconnect

the others are self explanatory
-skip
-pause
-resume
-loop


I don't think anyone would come to this repo but If you did and If you're confused on how to install it start a new Issue I'll update the readme file and help you to install it
